   <h1> New York Times Games </h1>
     <p1> A long-standing tradition for 2nd period, everyday starts with the Mini Crossword and Wordle of the day from the NYT
       <br>
       <h2> The Mini </h2>
       <p2> The Mini is by far the most popular of the NYT games for our corner of the room. 
         <br>
         We compare times (Ryan having somehow always finishing it earlier and making fun of our struggles) 
         <br>
         and enjoy the beginning few minutes of class.

       <h2> Wordle </h2>
         <p2> The wordle is popular, although not to the same extent (a lot of cheating is involved with the screens around). 
           <br>
           Creative first word choices are a must. </p2>

       <h2> Sudoku </h2>
         <p2> The most tame but least popular choice-a go to for lectures because it requires a different type of thinking 
           <br>
           (but never in CSP of course we would never). </p2>
